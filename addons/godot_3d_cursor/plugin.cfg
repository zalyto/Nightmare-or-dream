name="Godot 3D Cursor"
description="This plugin for the Godot Engine implements a 3D cursor, offering functionality similar to Blender’s 3D cursor.\n\nNote: Due to certain engine limitations, you must switch to a tab other than 3D (e.g., 2D, Script, or AssetLib) and back to 3D once after enabling this plugin, and also upon engine startup, to activate the plugin correctly.\n\nUsage: You can set the 3D cursor's position by using Shift + Right Click."
